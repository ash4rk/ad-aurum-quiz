Incorrect choices are highlighted in red. After completing all the questions, players can view basic statistics of their answers. Additionally, users have the option to set the maximum number of answers to be displayed.

## How to add question

The questions are composed from 'questions.json' of the following structure:

```
[
{
  "question": "Question text goes here",
  "answers": [
    {"text": "Answer 1", "correct": true},
    {"text": "Answer 2", "correct": false},
    ...
  ],
  "background": "path/to/background/image.jpg"
},
...
]

```
## Time tracking

In total, I spent about six hours on this project. Three hours were spent on the functionality and three on the visual part.
All this time recording a screencast. Still found design flaws and minor bugs for a while.
